Research Scientist at [Mirelo AI](https://www.mirelo.ai), developing multimodal foundation models for music and sound generation.

I’m a Research Scientist at [Mirelo AI](https://www.mirelo.ai), working on multimodal foundation models for video, music, and sound. My core responsibilities include building our audio codecs, large-scale data pipelines, and model benchmarking and training, covering the full ML workflow from dataset preparation to distributed training.

I earned my Ph.D. (Dr.-Ing.) at the [International Audio Laboratories Erlangen](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de), a joint institution of [Fraunhofer IIS](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de) and [FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.de), under [Bernd Edler](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/edler). I also spent time at Microsoft’s [Applied Sciences Group](https://www.microsoft.com/applied-sciences), working on area-based sound source separation with [Okan Köpüklü](https://www.microsoft.com/applied-sciences/people/okan-k%C3%B6p%C3%BCkl%C3%BC), contributed to dialogue-enhancement research at Fraunhofer IIS, and worked at INRIA in Rennes on sound source localisation using drones together with [Antoine Deleforge](https://members.loria.fr/ADeleforge/home/).

Before specialising in audio AI, I earned a Master’s in Medical Image and Data Processing, a Bachelor’s in Medical Engineering, and earlier a Bachelor in Sports Science at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/).
